# Checkers for nerds
This is checkers for nerds, its very intuitive but only if you are used to working with REST api's. There is no user 
interface but feel free to build one. You can play against a friend or you could build a client which acts as a player 
and play against it after all it is a rest api, who knows who goes behind player2.
