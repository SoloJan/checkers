# Checkers for nerds
This is checkers for nerds, its very intuitive but only if you are used to working with REST api's. It has the latest 
and greatest frameworks. It runs on multiple database types including an in memory database which just works automatically.  
And the database is kept up to date with flyway, so you never have any problem migrating between versions. 
It uses spring boot witch means that it comes with a build in webserver. 
It has swagger as a documentation tool and rest assured to test the api's and 
a ci/cd pipeline in github which checks for 90% unit test coverage.

There is no user interface but feel free to build one. You can play against a friend, or you could build a client 
which acts as a player and play against it after all it is a rest api, who knows who goes behind player2.

You probably not really into playing checkers and you probably just start looking at the source code but if you really 
want to play start reading the readme in the backend project on how to get started

# Checkers for managers
So there is also a frontend project which is basically a static HTML5 file with some javascript,
never mind forget the tech talk. The good news is you can play checkers on a board which actually looks like a 
checkers board. It has colors and pictures and all kinds of things. It is much more easy to use you don't need to login or 
anything just open it in a browser and start playing. THE BROWSER. Never mind I mean the thing you open the internet 

I said in a BROWSER

Never mind I mean the thing you open the internet with, yes your normal internet. 

So this is a web application ?

No it is a static HTML 5 file with no connection to the web whatsoever.

HTML sounds web to me. 

And the great thing is it took a lot less time to make and it has a lot less code to maintain. The code is not that good
and I would not show it to anyone, certainly not in a job interview, but you did not ask for code you asked for checkers.
And you don't need to read a different readme either just look for the file called checkers.html in the frontend folder 
and click on it.
